## About this rep

This rep is the backend for the website "hire me now". It contains skills: Conda, Django, OpenAI, Restful.

## Setup Envrionment

To totally run this code, you need: 

  - [Setup necessary system environment](#1-setup-necessary-system-environment)
  - [Setup suitable Python version](#2-setup-suitable-python-version)
  - [Setup necessary environment variables](#3-setup-necessary-environment-variables)

---

### 1. Setup necessary system environment
 To setup enrironment for this website app, you need to perpare the following tools: `shell`, [conda/miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).  
 
 - With `shell` (which is already in your computer!), we can use conda/miniconda, install pacages, and run our website. 
 
 - With `conda/miniconda`, we would be convinent to manage our python versions. Conda is a useful tool which integrate many platform such as: Jupyter notebook, Pycharm, ect. However, I would highly recommanded you just install **miniconda**. This is because if you don't need that much platforms (At least I don't need so much), then miniconda will **save you a lot of spaces**. At the same time, it's also **effectively enough for us to manage our python environments**, which is the main target for us to use in this project. Therefore, here I just put how to install miniconda for your computer.

PS: Here I provided one method of how to use shell and miniconda. Feel free to use another shell tools or conda, they should work well.

If you are a **Windows** user:
 
  1.  Open your shell. You need to tape **'win+R'** on your keyboard, and then type **'cmd'**, so that you will get your shell.

  2. Download [miniconda - for windows](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#windows-installers). Just download the installer and click 'next' would be fine. Please check your computer to make sure it's 32 bit or 64 bit.


If you are a **Mac** user:

  1. Open your shell. You need to tape **'Command+space'** on your keyboard, and then enter **'terminal'**, so that you will get your shell.

  2. Download [miniconda - for mac](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#macos-installers). Just download the .pkg file and click 'next' would be fine.


Check if your miniconda works well in your shell:
```
(base) PS YourUserLocation> conda --version  ## Type "conda --version" in your shell.
conda 22.11.1                                ## You should get result like (Depending on the version of your conda)
```


### 2. Setup suitable Python version

The python version we used in this project is python 3.11. And all the pacages we used is in [requirements.txt](##env.yml). The followings is the details about how to setup a suitable python environment for this project.

First, open your shell (See details in [previous](#1-setup-necessary-system-environment)). Then, git clone our project to your location by:
```
git clone https://github.com/nnanwang/HireMe_NOW.git
```
Then, change your shell location to your project:
```
cd project-location
```
After that, use conda to create an environment for this project:
```
conda create -n hire_me_now python=3.11
``` 
Then, we have an environment which calls 'hire_me_now', we need to activate this environment first, and install the pacages we need:
```
conda activate hire_me_now    # you should see the env name in the brackets changed from 'base' to 'hire_me_now'
pip install -r requirements.txt    # install packages we need
```

### 3. Setup necessary environment variables

For the final step, our website requires some specific private environment variables. These parameters are integral but harmful when you share them to public, such as OpenAIAPIKey(Others can use it and incur costs). Therefore, you need to set up these variables as local environment variables to make sure these variables can only be seen on your computer.

For setup envrionment variables, all you need to do is create a file, named **'.env'**, into your **hmn_project** folder. Then, in your **'.env'** file, you need to add the following contents:

```
OPEN_AI_KEY=[Your_OpenAIKey_Value]
CORS_ADD=http://localhost:3000
```

OPEN_AI_KEY: You need to replace [Your_OpenAIKey_Value] with your own **OpenAIKey**. For more details, please read [OpenAI document](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key).

CORS_ADD: You can replace **CORS_ADD** with your own frontend server address.

Now you are ready to develop this project (Yeah!)



## Develop Project
